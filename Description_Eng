# MyBank Console Application

This Python program, named MyBank, is a console-based banking application that allows users to create accounts, make deposits, withdrawals, check balances, and view transaction history.

## Features

1. **SQLite Database Integration**: The program uses an SQLite database named `mybank.db` to store account information and transaction history.

2. **Account Class**: The `Account` class is responsible for managing individual accounts. It allows users to create new accounts or access existing ones. Account information includes a unique name and a balance.

3. **Transaction History**: The program keeps track of transaction history, including the date, amount, and status (deposit or withdrawal). The history is stored in the `history` table in the SQLite database.

4. **Main Menu**: The main program includes a menu with options for user interaction, such as logging in, creating a new account, and exiting the application.

5. **Operations Menu**: Once logged in, users can perform various operations, including depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking their balance, viewing transaction history, and exiting the application.

## Database Schema

The SQLite database consists of two tables:

- **accounts**: Stores information about each account, including an ID, name, and balance.
